Selam teacher:
This is a description on how to setup the project file on your pc:
 1.first import the database named "bus_ticket.sql".
   Then there are tables inside it.
   then you can go to admin menu and sign up to login or you can use 
    username="Abrish" and password="1234" as an example.
 you can see things there after you login.
   



   finally i am asking you to tolerate some duplications and unclearness
   of the project with great excuse.

   wishing you to have good time.
